<p>There are times in life where you simply don't know where you will end up. For me, a chance encounter in Puerto Rico
    lead to a rather interesting series of events. I have spent the previous week (October 20th-26th) attending the <a
        href="https://meetings.icann.org/en/barcelona63">ICANN 63rd International Public Meeting</a>. For those who
    aren't familiar with the <a href="https://icann.org/">Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
        (ICANN)</a>, it is essentially the not-for-profit organization that administrates the Internet root zone which
    forms the linchpin of the modern internet, and allows domain names such as soylentnews.org to exist.</p>

<p>As a fellow, I have been working to help advance policy from the perspective of Internet end-users, as well as
    improving access to the Internet in the form of Internationalized Domain Names. For those less familiar with the
    technical underpinnings of the Internet, I'll also talk a bit about DNS, and more of the work I am currently in the
    process of handling at ICANN.</p>

<p><b>DNS - What is it?</b></p>

<p>Before we can talk about ICANN in any fashion, we need to talk a bit about the Domain Name System, or DNS. Every
    computer on the internet is assigned one or more numbers known as IP addresses. IP addresses take the form of
    23.239.29.31 or 2600:3c00::f03c:91ff:fe98:90b, and are used as ways of uniquely identifying every device. Every site
    and service has an IP address, as does your phone and computer to allow two way communication; they can be best
    thought of telephone numbers for computers.</p>

<p>Just like phone numbers, there needs to be a method to look up information based on name. In the days of old, we
    would use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_pages">Yellow Pages</a> for this type of information.
    For computers, our version of the yellow pages is DNS, specifically what we call A and AAAA records. For example,
    here are two types of lookup requests for SoylentNews:</p>



<p>
<pre>
$ nslookup
&gt; server 8.8.8.8
Default server: 8.8.8.8
Address: 8.8.8.8#53
&gt; soylentnews.org
Server:		8.8.8.8
Address:	8.8.8.8#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	soylentnews.org
Address: 23.239.29.31
Name:	soylentnews.org
Address: 2600:3c00::f03c:91ff:fe98:90b</pre>
</p>

<p>Besides basic name lookup information, DNS often contains information such as mail routing in the form of MX records,
    or even user authentication data in the form of Hesiod TXT records. It would be fair to call DNS the worlds largest
    distributed dynamic database. At its core, DNS is comprised of a network of worldwide servers that provide name
    lookup services from the internet, starting from the root of a tree.</p>

<p><b>The Internet Root Zone, Top Level Domains, and Second Level Domains</b></p>

<p>When I said root of a tree, I wasn't being very metaphorical. Let's look a little closer at an actual domain name,
    and break it down into its component parts, in this case, our development site at dev.soylentnews.org. For the
    purposes of demonstration, we'll walk the domain from the top down. Each section of a domain name is divided into
    levels separated by a period. So dev is a third level domain, soylentnews is a second level domain, and org is a top
    level domain.</p>

<p>Likewise, each of these levels points to the one higher than it. Let's ask the soylentnews domain about dev; our
    hosting provider (and DNS servers) are hosted by Linode so we'll query them directly.</p>

<p>
<pre>
$ nslookup
&gt; server ns1.linode.com
Default server: ns1.linode.com
Address: 2400:cb00:2049:1::a29f:1a63#53
Default server: ns1.linode.com
Address: 162.159.27.72#53
&gt; dev.soylentnews.org
Server:		ns1.linode.com
Address:	2400:cb00:2049:1::a29f:1a63#53

Name:	dev.soylentnews.org
Address: 72.14.185.204
Name:	dev.soylentnews.org
Address: 2600:3c00::f03c:91ff:fe6e:d0a3
</pre>
</p>


<p>Notice that the "Non-authoritative answer" is missing. This is because soylentnews.org directly controls the level
    above it. We can see the same effect if we query the .org nameservers for SoylentNews; note that we need to ask for
    the NS record type which acts as a pointer to the next level of domain.</p>

<blockquote>
    <div>
        <p>

<p>Cool! We can see the five nameservers that have authoritative data for soylentnews.org. But how did I find the
    nameserver for .org? Well, I queried the internet root zone for it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The root zone contains all information on all the top level domains, as well as the special KSK (<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions#Key_management">Key Signing Keys</a>)
    keys that underpin the DNSSEC system. In domain names, the root zone is represented as a final '.' at the end of the
    domain which is typically implied although there are rare technical reasons where it has to be referred to directly.
    Now that we've discussed and slightly explored the root zone, let's talk about the organization that administrates
    it, and the policy and rules related to the root, and the top-level domains referenced within.</p>

<p><b>What is ICANN?</b></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.icann.org/history">full history of ICANN</a> is too long to recap here, but in short, ICANN
    is a multi-stakeholder community that represents various stakeholder groups and their interests and needs. In no
    specific order, these groups are as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>GAC</b> - Government Advisory Committee</li>
    <li><b>SSAC</b> - Security and Stability Advisory Committee</li>
    <li><b>RSSAC</b> - Root Server System Advisory Committee</li>
    <li><b>GNSO</b> - Generic Names Supporting Organization</li>
    <li><b>ccNSO</b> - Country Code Names Supporting Organization</li>
    <li><b>CSG</b> - Commercial Stakeholder Group</li>
    <li><b>ASO</b> - Address Supporting Organization</li>
    <li><b>At-Large/ALAC</b> - At Large Advisory Community (Internet Endusers)</li>
</ul>

<p>That's a LOT of acronyms, groups, and organizations, and this isn't even a complete list. Each of these groups (known
    as stakeholders) are essentially cross-sections of all internet users and work to drive policy that meet the goals
    of their interests and charters. Other groups primarily act in an advisory role such as SSAC in evaluating impact of
    policy changes to the ICANN board. ICANN stakeholder groups create working groups (many of which are open to the
    public) to accomplish goals and draft policy, respond to public policy comments, and create a final report. These
    are then followed by implementation.</p>

<p>As you can plainly see, ICANN is a massive multi-headed hydra that at first is not the most user-friendly beast to
    approach. At least from my perspective, getting involved was rather difficult. For this purpose, ICANN offers two
    programs to help get people involved: a <a href="https://www.icann.org/fellowshipprogram">fellowship program</a> to
    bring both those with diversity or unique skills in and the <a
        href="https://www.icann.org/public-responsibility-support/nextgen">NextGen program</a>. I can't speak on
    NextGen, but I can speak to the fellowship program, and my personal story in how I both got involved and the topics
    and work I was involved in at ICANN63.

</p>

<p><b>ICANN Fellowship Program</b></p>

<p>To talk about my experience as a fellow, we need to go back to February 2018 when I was in San Juan, Puerto Rico,
    visiting with a friend. While I was there, I saw large banners with the ICANN name and logo and some sort of
    conference. While I did not know the specifics at the time, what I was seeing was the ICANN61 General Policy Forum.
    As such, I walked in off the street, registered for a badge, and sat down at a high level meeting regarding an issue
    known as name collision hosted by the SSAC. This, and a few other meetings convinced me that becoming involved with
    ICANN was something I was personally interested in.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, getting your foot in the door with ICANN from the outside is something of a tall order. To help solve
    this problem, ICANN offers a fellowship program to help bring both diversity and talent within the community. As
    such, I was selected to attend ICANN63 on the basis of my position as an independent freelancer combined with strong
    technical skills. The fellowship program, currently managed by Siranush Vardanyan, is meant to help bring people
    into the ICANN community and guide them into position and niches where their skillsets can help. Many within ICANN
    bring technical, legal, policy, and activism talents to the table, and it is an extremely inclusive community to say
    the least. As was oft-repeated, 'Once a fellow, always a fellow'. Through the fellowship program, I was assigned a
    coach, Alfredo Calderon who helped me get involved with the gTLD working groups, and help decode the maze that I
    described above.</p>

<p>The intent of the fellowship is to prepare those to attend a face-to-face meeting (in this case, ICANN63), and help
    the fellow become active within the ICANN community. In my case, I managed to hit the ground running as in the
    intervening months between ICANN61 and 63, I had gotten involved with the Internet Society, and several working
    groups within the IETF (albeit it on a semi-active basis). That combined with closely following the news allowed me
    to be productive from the start. What follows are issues that I was primarily involved with &mdash; it doesn't cover
    some of the larger discussions such as the GDPR/WHOIS policy development sessions.</p>

<p><b>New Generic Top Level Domains (gTLD) </b></p>

<p>Generic top level domains are generally the most common type of TLD most people encounter, comprising <tt>.com</tt>,
    <tt>.net</tt>, <tt>.org</tt>, etc. compared to the two letter country code TLDs (ccTLDs) such as <tt>.us</tt> or
    <tt>.io</tt>. Back in 2005, ICANN began developing policies to allow for the creation of new gTLDs, and in 2013,
    these new gTLDs began being added to the root zone as part of the <a href="https://newgtlds.icann.org/en/">New gTLD
        Program</a>. Since the initial land rush and additions, ICANN has been developing new rules relating to this
    process in the form of the <a
        href="https://community.icann.org/display/NGSPP/New+gTLD+Subsequent+Procedures+PDP+Home">New gTLD Subsequent
        Procedures PDP (Policy Development Process)</a> working group (known as the SubPro), which I'm a member of. I've
    primarily worked to ensure that not for profit and smaller communities can't be outbid or driven out of the process
    of obtaining their own gTLDs.</p>

<p>Expansion of the generic TLDs help relieve strain on the already crowded <tt>.com</tt>/<tt>.org</tt>/<tt>.net</tt>
    registries and pave the way for full internationalization of the internet (a topic I'll cover below). While there
    have those who've felt that expanding gTLDs was a mistake, the ability to have domains such as .nyc for sites
    relating to New York City has shown that the new gTLD program has real world benefits that we're already
    experiencing today. However, creating and expanding gTLDs also has opened a paradox's box of sorts which involves
    the SubPro, specifically in the the realm of string contention and name collisions.</p>

<p><b>String Contention and Name Collisions</b></p>

<p>In a perfect world, everyone would have one unique name and registering a new gTLD would be an easy and
    straightforward process. Unfortunately, we don't live in that sort of world; we live in a world where the Government
    of Brazil, and Amazon both want the <tt>.amazon</tt> TLD. This is what's known as a string contention; when multiple
    parties want the same domain string, and part of my work within the SubPro is building and designing mechanisms for
    handling contentions, as well as a last resort process which is fair for all parties. In the last round of gTLD
    additions, many string contentions were solved either by private party, or through a last resort auction process. At
    the direction of the ICANN board, the SubPro has been reviewing the results of this last round, ensuring that all
    actors, especially smaller community-based ones have an equal chance of being given a gTLD, and making sure no one
    can be strong-armed out of the process. I (and others within the SubPro) have been working on creating and
    streamlining the new gTLD process, and making sure that no single party can monopolize a string by simply
    outspending everyone. Of course, social issues aren't the only hangup when creating a new top-level domain; you can
    have a name collision.</p>

<p>Name collisions are a closely related problem dealing with the technical issues of what happens when you add a name
    to the root zone that's already in use in other contexts. For example, the Tor network could be entirely shafted if
    <tt>.onion</tt> was added to the root zone as it's used as a pseudo-TLD. Unfortunately, because of literally decades
    of bad practice, poor device coding, and similar historical artifacts, it means that the root zones get thousands of
    requests per second for bogus top level domains. As part of adding any new TLD, a review is done to determine the
    technical impact &mdash; research by SSAC into the name collision issue as a whole is ongoing. While I'm not
    personally involved in this work as of yet, I am interested in joining it in the near future</p>

<p><b>Internationalized Domain Names (IDN)</b></p>

<p>Last, but not least, the final major activity I worked on was discussions related to the internationalization of
    domain names, and email address internationalization (EAI) with the goal of making ensuring the web is available for
    everyone. Due to the fact that DNS was designed in 1987, it was never designed with internationalization in mind and
    has required some arcane hacks to make it work. Let's take the string <tt>тест</tt> which is Russian for test; it
    displays properly because we support UTF-8. However, DNS was never designed to work with 8-bit characters. Instead,
    a system was created known as punycode. This system represents unicode in ASCII in a method that DNS can handle; so
    the domain <tt>тест.example</tt> becomes <tt>xn--e1aybc.example</tt> which can be handled by existing tools.</p>

<p>This however creates a disconnect between the displayed name (known as the U-label) and the ASCII representation
    (A-label) of a domain name, which is known to break software that either renders domain names, or in the cases of
    email, must amend information to its log files. It also leads to issues with SSL certificates, and other confusion
    within the ecosystem due to poor support. While IDNs have been around for awhile, new codepoints including
    right-to-left ones are being added that require more testing and development. I've started one of two projects to
    help study and test IDNs, and an active participant of the Universal Acceptance mailing lists on the subject.</p>

<p><b>dnscatcher and idn-root-zone</b></p>

<p>As part of the meetings and other work, I've started work on two projects to help raise awareness and study ongoing
    problems with the world of DNS by creating tools to help monitor the health of the ecosystem as a whole. The first
    of these is a project that I'm tentatively calling <a href="https://github.com/NCommander/dnscatcher">DNS
        Catcher</a>, and its intent is to study the perspective of the domain name system from the viewpoint of the end
    user.</p>

<p>As we know from study from data related to authoritative name servers, and the root zone, a lot of recursive
    revolvers and end-user devices send bogus data, such as catching all missing domains with a wildcard, or sending
    bogus requests to the root. DNS Catcher is an attempt to quantify the problem from the last mile and understand what
    data devices are sending out. While it's still in very early proof of concept, the catcher's end goal is to compare
    known good authorize zone data to data collected from various locations such as public access points and more so as
    to identify bad actors within the DNS community. It's still in the early pre-alpha stage, but my initial coding
    efforts have left me optimistic I may have an alpha version ready to go by the end of the year which will be subject
    to its own blog post.</p>

<p>The other is what I'm calling tentatively calling <a href="https://github.com/NCommander/idn-root-zone">Root Zone in
        a Box</a>, a series of shell scripts, instructions and docker containers to automatically recreate a simulation
    of the DNS root zone, and other core internet functionality to allow testing of potential changes to DNS, as well as
    help study and debug various issues related to Internationalized Domain Names. Compared to dnscatacher, I've gotten
    further on this project as it's somewhat higher priority. While likely not of interest to most as of yet, RZiaB is
    basically designed to help validate and ensure that internationalized domain names and email address
    internationalization works smoothly and that issues can be quickly identified and fixed using an easy-to-host
    environment that can be quickly set up.</p>

<p>I'll likely talk more of these projects in separate posts at later dates, but I invite people to comment and review
    my work.</p>

<p><b>Other Odds and Ends</b></p>

<p>As with any conference, there was various interesting conversations, discussions, and round tables that you really
    don't experience in a purely electronic environment. One of these (which was the direct inspiration for DNS catcher)
    was discussing why some devices send bogus data (in the form of random hex strings) to the internet root zone. I
    postulated that the answer was it was the one more-or-less sure fire way to know if you have anyone tampering with
    your DNS data such as captive portals, restrictive firewalls, or ISPs who don't like to return NXDomain.</p>

<p>Another big part are social dinners and gatherings. One personal highlight is I also had a fairly decent conversation
    with the appointed representative to the GAC from the Holy See, dealing with domain name issues relating to the
    Vatican. We primarily talked about working at the Vatican, the papacy's interest in ICANN, and life within the city.
    As far as unique individuals go, this easily makes a spot on my top ten list!</p>

<p><b>In Closing</b></p>

<p>Although my time in Barcelona has come to an end, my involvement within ICANN is higher than ever. We're doing strong
    work to try and keep the internet open and accessible to all, and we're always looking for anyone with an interest
    to get involved. The Fellowship experience helped me connect with individuals that let me reach my personal goals of
    working on the SubPro, as well as connected me to the IDN working group folks in a way that I hope to pave a new
    cornerstone of the internet for non-English speaking individuals. There's a lot of work ahead, but I can say with
    certainty that my work with ICANN will continue, and I look forward to what the future will hold. If you're
    interested in my projects, comment below, or follow me on Twitter: <a
        href="https://twitter.com/fossfirefighter">@fossfirefighter</a> where I post about my work on DNS catcher,
    RZiaB, and other things that don't make SoylentNews... like a retroBBS hacking project.</p>

<p><b>If You Want To Get Involved</b></p>

<p>If what you've read interests you, and you want to get involved in ICANN yourself, a good starting place is the <a
        href="https://atlarge-lists.icann.org/mailman/listinfo/alac-announce">alac-announce</a> mailing list which posts
    which working groups are in progress, have meetings, and other good information, as well as joining your regional
    At-Large community. Most working groups (WGs) don't require membership in a stakeholder group, so you can just dive
    in; you're simply expected to familiarize yourself with the WG's previous history up to that point for the most
    part. There is also a set of learning resources at <a href="https://learn.icann.org/#/login">learn.icann.org</a>,
    and I'm happy to take questions here or on Twitter.</p>

<p><b>Acknowledgements</b></p>

<p>Before signing off, I want to personally thank several individuals who helped me get here. First, <a
        href="https://icannwiki.org/Alfredo_Calderon">Alfredo Calderon</a>, my ICANN coach and <a
        href="https://icannwiki.org/Siranush_Vardanyan">Siranush Vardanyan</a>, manager of the fellowship program. Both
    were very understanding and helpful with some personal difficulties I ran into during the fellowship program and
    both of them contributed greatly to a successful face-to-face meeting. Next, I'd like to thank <a
        href="https://icannwiki.org/Martin_Silva_Valent">Martin Pablo Silva</a>, who continuously encouraged me to apply
    for the Fellowship, and helped make sure my application was in tip-top shape, and last, but not least, <a
        href="https://icannwiki.org/Thomas_Jalkanen">Dina Solveig Jalkanen</a> (who prefers to go by Thomas), who
    introduced me to ICANN and is a close personal friend and who is was instrumental in making this possible.</p>

<p>Until the next time ...</p>
