<p>After a bit of hitatus, I'm back with more retrocomputing madness. Several years ago, Microsoft donated the source
    code of Word for Windows 1.1a to the <a href="https://computerhistory.org/">Computer History Museum</a>. After a bit
    of initial news flury back in 2014, the topic mostly sat unnoticed. A few people, including
    <a href="https://virtuallyfun.com/wordpress/2018/08/30/compiling-microsoft-word-1-1a-for-windows/">neozeed from
        Virtually Fun</a> managed to compile the code from source from DOS. However, no one has really investigated too
    deep into the bowels of this codebase.</p>

<p>When I decided to dig into Word for Windows's (or Winword for short) source code, I found more than a few surprises,
    and decided that this
    was a topic that needed quite a bit more explaination. It was also a good excuse to finally tackle OS/2, something
    that had been on my list of topics for awhile since I also noticed that there was a full set of OS/2 compilation
    tools which lead to the genesis of this project. As it turn out, I would fall fairly far down the rabbit hole before
    coming back up for daylight. As usual, my findings are summarized in YouTube video form, and it would mean a lot of
    you took a look.

<h2>Word for Windows Introduction</h2>

<p>IMG: Word for Windows overview</p>
<p>I'm really not sure how much introduction Word actually needs. It's one of the most popular word processors in
    extensive, and I can't help but think that almost anyone has used it at one point or another. That being said, Word
    itself started from rather modest beginnings. Although initially released in 1983, the early versions struggled to
    find traction against WordPerfect. It was ironically the Macintosh versions that began to establish Microsoft as a
    player in this field.</p>

<p>IMG: Word for DOS/Macintosh</p>

<p>On the PC side of things, Word only began to establish dominance with the rise of Windows, and the
    difficulties in bringing a Windows version of WordPerfect to market. With it's largest competitor flailing, Word,
    combined with Excel would form the cornerstone of the upcoming Microsoft Office. By the end of the 90s, Microsoft
    would have this entire market segment on lockdown.</p>

<p>However, the early versions of Word, and especially Word for Windows, did have honest improvements over its
    competition. To demonstrate, let's get the retail release of Word 1.1a installed, and take a look. This version
    of Word required Windows 2.1 at a minimum, although the then upcoming Windows 3.0 was recommended. Installation is
    handled through a DOS application, which is typical of early Windows applications. Afterwords, we can jump into
    Windows, and take a look.</p>

<p>IMG: Word for Windows 1.1a on Windows 2.1</p>

<p>By modern standards, Word 1.1a is nothing to write home about. However, Winword is one of the earliest examples of a
    consumer WYSIWYG or "What You See is What You Get" text editors, and had fully integrated support for mouse control.
    In contrast, its main competition in WordPerfect 5.1 used colored based highlighting to show formatting, and only
    provided a limited Print Preview</p>

<p>IMG: WordPerfect color highlighting</p>

<p>Word also provided support for integrated graphics, and the beginnings of multimedia documents through Object Linking
    and Embedding, although this wouldn't be fully realized until later. In short, Word did provide real world
    advantages over its competition. While Microsoft was accused of underhanded tactics, leading to <a
        href="https://redmondmag.com/articles/2012/07/17/judge-rules-for-microsoft-in-novell-wordperfect-antitrust-lawsuit.aspx">Microsoft
        v. Novell</a>, it's impossible to deny that Word itself was a solid competitor on its own merits.</a> </p>

<p>As I would find though, a lot more of Microsoft's success in this field would be revealed as I dived in deeper.
    However, first I needed to get Winword compiled.</p>

<h2>The What and Why of OS/2</h2>
<p>IMG: OS/2 splash screen</p>

<p>I won't be surprised if quite a few people are wondering on why I chose OS/2 for this project. Well, there's a few
    reasons. The first is just compiling ontop of DOS is actually quite painful. While Microsoft included a full set of
    build tools for both DOS and OS/2, the DOS tools require oodles of conventional memory, and a fairly specific setup
    to actually get the build off the ground.</p>

<p>First, the tools are hardcoded to use the 386MAX memory extender. Microsoft helpfully included that in the box, and
    it works just fine on both DOS 3.3 and 6.2. However, because this extender is so old, DOS itself can't relocate to
    the UMA area, which decreases the total amount of conventional memory on the system. Attempting to use DOS=HIGH just
    leads to a system crash.
</p>

<p>IMG: 386MAX</p>

<p>While there are unofficial hacks to use <a href="https://www.japheth.de/HX.html">HX Memory Extender</a>, I preferred
    to stay with period specific tools if possible. Even after sorting the memory manager, I still kept getting build
    failures due to running out of memory. A lot of this is that for this era, the concept of a DOS Extender was still
    fairly new, and ontop of that, Microsoft was still expecting OS/2 to be the future of computing.</p>

<p>IMG: Out of memory failure</p>

<p>At this point in history (1989), Microsoft was still married to IBM in bringing the protected mode successor to DOS:
    OS/2. Originally announced in 1987, OS/2 was intended to bring proper multitasking and GUI based applications to the
    masses. While GUIs (and most notably Windows) had already existed at this point, they were still fairly niche. OS/2
    was intended to bring a revolution to both home and office users. However, by 1989, OS/2 was still struggling to
    find any significant marketshare, and the vast majority of users still continuing to use DOS as their day to day
    operating system.</p>

<p>It wasn't until the unexpected success of Windows 3.0 in 1990, followed by the IBM-Microsoft divorce did Microsoft
    truly abandon OS/2 as a platform, something we'll see later on. Given the time period though, I expected that
    Microsoft used OS/2 fairly extensively for both software development, and day-to-day usage. It's well documented
    that nearly all Microsoft products of that time period had OS/2 support, or a specific OS/2 version.</p>

<p>Microsoft's own develoment tools also supported OS/2. In truth, while OS/2 was somewhat of a flop with general
    consumers, it did have a niche for use in software development. This is primarily because OS/2 could multitask, use
    virtual memory, and bad code wouldn't necessarily crash the system. It also was possible to do "in-place" debugging,
    instead of a multi-machine setup as required by DOS and Windows of the era. Speaking from personal usage, OS/2 is
    also quite nice for using as the basis for retrocomputing projects instead of developing directly ontop of Windows
    or DOS.</p>

<p>To that end, I decided to go with OS/2 1.2, as it would have been relatively close to the time period in Winword 1.1
    was released. This would however lead to much pain and suffering.</p>

<h2>Half an Operating System - OS/2 1.2</h2>

<p>So, in theory, installing OS/2 is simple. Insert the Install disk, boot the system, and follow the prompts. In
    practice, I was greeting with the following ...</p>

<p>IMG: TRAP error</p>

<p>In practice, OS/2 actually is notoriously difficult to either emulate or virtualize due to it's use of features like
    x86 rings, and segmented protected mode. The original 16-bit versions of OS/2 (1.0-1.3) compound this issue by
    self-destructing on anything that isn't specifically what they want. In practice, OS/2 1.2 will not install on
    anyone system faster than a 33Mhz 386DX. The <a
        href="http://www.os2museum.com/wp/installing-os2-1-x-in-a-virtualbox-vm/">OS/2 Museum</a> has actually debugged
    this issue, and written unofficial patches to fix it. However, I decided to simply stick with slower emulation in
    the name of "authenticity". This would end up being a rather painful mistake. Still, with proper machine settings
    set, I managed to get to the boot splash screen.</p>

<p>IMG: OS/2 installation boot splash screen</p>

<p>Installation is pretty straight forward, but there are a few things to note. First, IBM's High Performance File
    System isn't an option yet. HPFS was the intended replacement for FAT, but it would only appear near the end of OS/2
    1.x's lifespan, and then as an optional component. Secondly is the truly abysmal hardware support. There are four
    graphic driver <i>en total</i>.</i></p>

<p>IMG: graphic driver list</p>

<p>While people off-state a lack of native OS/2 software as the major con against the system, a lack of hardware support
    was as bad if not worse. The Microsoft branded versions of OS/2 are slightly better in this regard, but OS/2's poor
    hardware support would be a defining trait. It's also the reason why I was stuck in 640x480 16-color mode through
    this entire project.</p>

<p>Lack of hardware support aside, the installation finished without much fanfare, and we end up at what can be
    described as the single blandest desktop known to mankind.</p>

<p>IMG: blandness</p>

<p>As I stated in the YouTube video, OS/2 didn't come with much. The only real program of note is the system text
    editor, known as E. It's safe to say that "batteries aren't included" was infact a thing that IBM did. OS/2 2.x
    would be much improved in that regard, but in short, if you didn't have native OS/2 versions, you either had to hope
    you could get Presentation Manager versions of your applications, or roll the dice with the DOS box.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, the DOS box, I should probably talk about that more in-depth.</p>

<p>IMG: DOS Penality box</p>

<p>As the intended successor to DOS, OS/2 does have some support for running DOS application. However, OS/2's reputation
    for near perfect backwards compatibility wouldn't come until 2.0. In truth, the DOS box is somewhat of a joke.
    Because OS/2 was designed around the 286 processor, it doesn't take advantage of Virtual 8086 Mode, or any sort of
    sandboxing. That means DOS programs can crash or hang the system, which negates one of the primary advantages of
    OS/2. Furthermore, only one DOS application can be run at a time, and only in full screen mode, although
    applications can be backgrounded, and one can return to Presentation Manager.</p>

<p>I didn't spend a lot of time in DOS mode, but it's rather notable that even a well-behaving, and popular program like
    WordPerfect has compatibility issues. I can't imagine a world where one would attempt to use DOS mode seriously as
    shipped from IBM.</p>

<p>At some point, I would like to go into the flaws and failures of OS/2 more in-depth as that would be a rather long
    and detailed set of articles and videos. Still, let's remember why we're here, to compile Word for Windows.</p>

<h2>The CHM Distribution</h2>

<p>With OS/2 installed, it was time to punt the code over to OS/2. Since OS/2 still uses standard DOS FAT filesystems,
    it was fairly trivial to simply mount the virtual disk, copy the files over, and then start exploring. The first
    thing I need to talk about though is the license. I'm going to apologize in advance, because this is something of a
    rant.</p>

<p>IMG: License</p>
<p>I brought up during the video how the Winword license only allows non-commerical use, but I didn't really elaborate.
    While I'm grateful that the Word for Windows source is legally available, the restrictive license on it really makes
    it something as a poison pill. The ugly truth of the world is a lot of content, research, and even media production
    is commercial in nature, and that audience can't touch Winword at all. Although my channel as of writing is still
    small enough that it doesn't meet YouTube's monetization requirements, I would have still done this project because
    I believe of the importance of documenting these sorts of things, but I know I'm in a minority in that regard.</p>
<p>Even disregarding the non-commercial restriction, the inability to publish any source, binaries, or modified works is
    really pushing this. I can get that Microsoft intended this as a museum piece and in that context, maybe such
    restrictions are understandable, but I do feel like it doesn't help anyone to be so draconian. I had to do a lot of
    tap-dancing to avoid showing code snippets and a lot of "tell, not show" to work with this content at all.</p>
<p>It's easier to comply with the license in text, but I do feel a lot of this is unnecessary. I suppose I shouldn't
    complain; after all, Word didn't have to get it's source code published at all, but it still grinds my gears.</p>

<p>Anyway, with that rant out of the way, let's get back to the CHM distribution. The zip file has three folders, with
    the bulk of the source code being in the "Opus" directory.</p>

<p>IMG: Opus layout</p>

<p>Opus, as one might gather, was the code name for Winword. The source code is fairly well organized, and there are
    decent comments within which give a pretty detailed picture of how Word was built which also helped build and
    explain. In truth, I've only gone through a fraction of it.
    cloc gives a pretty good look at how large this codebase actually is!</p>

</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> cloc's language detection is a little hit or miss, but it's still pretty easy to see there's a lot to
    unpack here!</p>

<p>As I previously mentioned, Microsoft was kind enough to bundle both the compiler and header files needed to build
    Winword, but there was a surprise to be found here.</p>

<p>IMG: csl</p>

<p>Contrary to expectations, Winword did not ship with Microsoft C. Instead, it's C compiler is known as CSL and it's a
    truly unique beast.</p>

<h2>Unexpected Findings</h2>
<p>I should explain my surprise here. In addition to Windows and OS/2, one of Microsoft's major revenue streams was
    providing compilers and tools. While Microsoft's tools were more expensive than say Borland or Watcom C, they were
    still both commonly used and frequent fixtures through this time period. In addition to their DOS based tools,
    Microsoft's tools were fundamental to Windows and OS/2 development, and also provided the basis of Xenix's C
    compiler. As such, it was a relatively reasonable expectation that a Microsoft product would use a Microsoft
    compiler to build it.</p>

<p>csl however is not your run of the mill compiler. Instead of compiling to standard x86 assembly language, it compiles
    to p-code. Infact, the entirity of Word for Windows is built into embedded language, and run ontop of an interperter
    called "the Embedded Language" as seen in the source comments.</p>

<p><b>Opus/el.h</b>
<pre>
/* el.h: Embedded Language definitions for use by the application.  Contains
* definitions of all EL data structures which are referred to in the API
* document.
*/    
</pre>
</p>

<p>In fact, there's an entire document file dedicated to EL (which is also referred to as Embedded BASIC), and
    how it was used in other products included in the winword distribution.</p>

<p><b>OpusEtAl/cashmere/doc/opel.doc</b>

    Specification of Opel
    The Opus Extension Language

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document describes the extensions to and user interface of the
Embedded BASIC (EB) in Opus.  For information concerning data types,
control structures, and other core-language features, please refer to
the document "Embedded Language System, Opus Version" by Craig
Wittenberg of the Applications Tools Group.

</pre>
</p>

<p>csl targets EL instead fo x86 as a whole, and from what I can tell, variants of EL were also used in Multiplan and
    early Excel. I also have reason to believe that EL's use continued far past 1989. csl reports a copyright date of
    1982, so it's not hard to believe that Microsoft used EL or some variant of it for an extended period both before
    and after winword.</p>

<p>The use of p-code isn't the only surprise though. Normal Windows programs use what are known as resource files to
    define menus, dialog boxes, and more. Once again, Microsoft has abstracted this. A special compiler for these
    resources known as 'de' is built. It even has a character based interface for laying out dialog elements!</p>

<p>IMG: de</p>

<p>In truth, aside from MASM, almost every tool in Opus appears either internal to Microsoft, or a pre-release or a port
    of another tool. For example, a native version of MARK is provided, which we saw back in <a
        href="//articles/2020/05/examining-windows-1.0-hello.c-35-years-of-backwards-compatibility/">compiling Hello
        World for Windows 1.0 is provided as native OS/2 binary!</a></p>

<p>It does make me wonder where and how Microsoft had stored the Winword 1.1a source. It's possible that this release
    was stored with Microsoft's legal department: Raymond Chen, a Microsoft employee behind <a
        href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">The Old New Thing</a> notes that the legal department would
    often store and collect older versions of Microsoft products, and it wouldn't surprise me of this source was also
    used during the discovery process of Microsoft v. Novell. While I doubt I'll ever know for sure, its interesting to
    think about how Microsoft might have preserved this and presented it to the CHM.</p>

<p>Surprises aside, if I wanted to actually get anywhere, I still needed to get with compiling.</p>

<h2>Missing Tools, and Compile Errors</h2>

<p>IMG: makeopus help</p>

<p>Fortunately, I wasn't entirely running blind here. Instructions for the DOS version of the build were relatively easy
    to find, and it stood to reason that the OS/2 version of the tools were vastly similar. In short, I needed to add
    C:\OPUS\TOOLS and C:\OPUS\TOOLS\OS2 to the PATH, and create a TEMP directory. Afterwords, I could use the makeopus
    command to kickstart the build. makeopus is similar to a Makefile generator or Microsoft's own take of a configure
    script. It reads a special configuration file for flags and options, and generates makefiles for NMAKE based on
    those options.</p>

<p>IMG: makeopus config files</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my first attempt blew up before I could even get past the starting line. The cause was relatively easy
    to spot though, makeopus was trying to use the DOS version of the compile tools. At least under OS/2 1.2, DOS
    utilities could only be used within the DOS window, so this wasn't going to fly. A closer examination of the help
    however reveals that there is a specific "MAKEOS2" option for makeopus that's for 'Protected Mode' builds. Many
    Microsoft tools such as Microsoft C often referred to OS/2 as a Protected Mode environment, so this is consistent
    with Microsoft's terminology of the time. Adding MAKEOS2 to our build configuration file got the build going, but it
    wasn't too long until we hit another build failure.</p>

<p>IMG: SYS0197 failures</p>

<p>In this case, it's the 'de' utility I talked about earlier dying. OS/2 has one feature I do appreicate, clear error
    messages, and an extensive built-in help. By typing help sys1097, we can see what failed, and how to fix it. In this
    case, it's the fact that 'de' needs a feature called IOPL segments to be enabled. Enabling IOPL is pretty trivial;
    its a one line change to CONFIG.SYS, although amusingly the HELP message is accurately inaccurate, you need to use
    IOPL=true,
    and not IOPL=yes</p>

<p>IMG: IOPL help msg</p>
<p>IMG: IOPL true</p>

<p>The need for IOPL is frankly mystifying for me. IOPL controls the ability to use x86 rings, specifically, for code to
    load into ring 2 and touch IO ports directly.</p>

<p>IMG: ring diagram</p>

<p>For the life of me, I can't figure out why a compiler needs this functionality; its possible it's trying to write
    some sort of diagnostic messages through to the serial port, and that functionality was copy and pasted from DOS,
    but from what I've read about IOPL segment programming in OS/2 programming guides makes this seem unlikely. The
    source code to 'de' is not available, so short of sitting several hours trying to decompile the tool, this will
    likely remain an unsolved mystery. Still, it was a problem with an easy solution, so it didn't take too long to back
    on track.</p>

<p>With that hurdle passed, the build dragged along. Unfortunately, as easy as it was to get back on track, it wasn't
    long until I got to another build failure though. Annoyingly, the command output had been hidden by makeopus, so I
    couldn't see what had failed. Working backwards through the makeopus utility, I found that the entire build process
    is written out as a shell script called 'mo2.cmd'. From there, some trial and error brought me to the failing
    command 'egrep'.</p>

<p>IMG: egrep build failure</p>
<p>IMG: mo2 output</p>

<p>Running egrep by itself shows the same error in the build folder. However, running 'egrep' in the DOS window
    succeeds. Obviously, we've got a problem here. Many of the binaries shipped in the TOOLS folder are what's known as
    family mode binaries, meaning that they contain DOS and OS/2 versions in one single version. For example, we can see
    this with the makeopus tool.</p>
<pre>
mcasadevall@absolution:~/src/word/Word 1.1a CHM Distribution/Opus/tools$ file makeopus.exe 
makeopus.exe: MS-DOS executable, NE for OS/2 1.x (EXE)
</pre>

<p>fgrep and grep are on the other hand shipped with two different versions, explaining on why they work:</p>
<pre>
mcasadevall@absolution:~/src/word/Word 1.1a CHM Distribution/Opus/tools$ find . -name \*grep\*
./dos/vgrep.exe
./dos/fgrep.exe
./dos/grep.exe
./egrep.exe
./dsrgrep.com
./os2/vgrep.exe
./os2/fgrep.exe
./os2/grep.exe    
</pre>

<p>egrep however doesn't fall into either category. Despite being in the common tools directory, it is <b>not</b> a
    family mode executable.</p>

<pre>
mcasadevall@absolution:~/src/word/Word 1.1a CHM Distribution/Opus/tools$ file egrep.exe 
egrep.exe: MS-DOS executable
</pre>

<p>Needless to say, this was a problem. Without a functional copy of egrep, I couldn't build Winword without some rather
    ugly brain surgery. That being said, despite the setback, I was fairly optimistic I could get around this problem.
    egrep is a fairly standard utility, and an examination of the binary with strings showed that Microsoft had almost
    certainly ported grep and friends from Xenix. Some testing also suggested that there was nothing really unique about
    the egrep binary as shipped from Opus. Given I did have a set of normal compilers (Microsoft C), compiling a
    replacement egrep was entirely practical.
</p>

<p>At this point though, I found someone had already done the hard part for me. Back in the early 90s, <a
        href="https://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/gnuish/gnuish.htm">the GNUish project</a> had ported
    several <a href=http://gnu.org>GNU</a> utilities to early DOS ad OS/2, including GNU grep</a>. A member of the
    Virtually Fun discord group pointed this out to me, and that the <a href="https://freedos.org">FreeDOS project</a>
    had archived the lot. Some searching later, and I did indeed find a copy of egrep compiled for OS/2.</a></p>

<p>Some testing confirmed that the Opus DOS egrep, and the GNU egrep command functioned identically!</p>

<p>A few renamed files, and we're back in business!</p>

<p>IMG: Building</p>

<p>It took literal hours for the next attempt to process. At 33Mhz, the system was straining to compile the monster that
    was Word for Windows. According to the raw video footage, I have over three and half hours of footage from this
    alone. However, perseverance is a virtue, as the build did in fact succeed!</p>

<p>IMG: Build done</p>

<p>The question is, would it run? As far as I know, I'm the first to actually attempt building Winword on OS/2 outside
    of Microsoft. Furthermore, the end result is a Windows binary, and we're on OS/2 so there's implied pain the arse
    to deal with, but I think is now a good time to segway to the implied elephant in the room.</p>

<h2>Who Needs Win-OS/2?</h2>
<p>IMG: Win-OS/2</p>

<p>For those familiar with the later versions of OS/2, you might be wondering why I haven't brought up Win-OS/2. Well,
    the answer is simple: it didn't exist yet. IBM eventually marketed OS/2 as a better Windows than Windows, and a
    better DOS than DOS. While there was some truth to those claims, that didn't come until after the IBM-Microsoft
    divorce. At the time, OS/2 being the future was still the party line at both Microsoft and IBM, with Windows only
    being a stopgap until then.</p>

<p>To that end, to a 1989 IBM, there would have been no need to license and include Windows with OS/2. Given how
    hamstrung DOS support already is, this is probably a good thing. That being said, as it turns out, you can
    <b>add</b> Windows support if you really want it.</b></p>

<p>As it turns out, Windows 3.0 (and ONLY 3.0) officially supported OS/2 as a host environment. Simply insert the first
    disk, and run SETUP as usual from the DOS box, and follow the prompts.</p>

<p>IMG: Windows SETUP</p>

<p>It should be noted that this is actually an officially supported feature of Windows 3.0, and directly mentioned in
    the README file!</p>

Running Windows from the OS/2 version 1.2 DOS Compatibility Box
---------------------------------------------------------------
  *  Do not allow Windows Setup to make changes to your
     AUTOEXEC.BAT file or CONFIG.SYS file. Make the appropriate
     changes yourself.

  *  To print, you must set the printer driver port to one with
     an .OS2 extension as follows:

     If your printer is physically connected to LPT1 or to LPT2,
     when you configure your printer, make sure you set the
     printer-driver port to LPT1.OS2 or LPT2.OS2.

     If the printer is physically connected to LPT3 or LPT4, you
     must create a line for LPT3.OS2 or LPT4.OS2 in the [ports]
     section of your WIN.INI file and then set the printer
     driver to the appropriate .OS2 port when you configure it.

     For more information about WIN.INI settings, see the
     on-line document called WININI.TXT.

<p>In truth, this isn't really that useful. Windows is stuck running in Real Mode meaning most Windows 3+ software
    simply work work. In addition, the command line and DOS applications are locked out with a unique error message.</p>

<p>That being said, the retail release of Winword 1.1 <b>does</b> work in real mode, and this environment is enough to
    run our freshly compiled one as well!</p>

<p>IMG: Winword ABOUT</p>

<p>So mission accomplished! We managed to build Word for Windows from OS/2, but there's a fair bit more to say on the
    topic.</p>

<p>PMWORD and Friends ...</p>

<p>In a broader context though, it helps to talk about Winword in the larger context of the world. As previously
    menthoned, Word was available for DOS, and there was also a version of Word for OS/2, which is also known as PMWORD.
    Let's look at Word for OS/2 before we wrap this up.</p>

<p>IMG: PMWORD Setup</p>
<p>IMG: PMWORD Group</p>
<p>Installing PMWORD is almost identical to regular Word, aside from the black and white Setup. After installation, we
    end up with a new program group in OS/2 with a single application. Running it though has a bigger surprise.</p>

<p>IMG: PMWORD startup</p>
<p>IMG: PMWORD running</p>
<p>IMG: PMWORD about</p>

<p>Is it just me, or does this look hauntingly familiar? I can say there's little to no specific code for OS/2 in the
    Winword source, but I do actually have a reasonably good idea of what's going on. We're going to dig into that, and
    Word's surprisingly complicated family tree next time, as well as clear up some more of the lingering mysteries.</p>

<h2>In Closing</h2>
<p>What I thought would be a relatively simple and straight forward project has ended with more than a few questions.
    For example, why was Word compiled to p-code, and what was the relationship across multiple versions. Furthermore,
    I'm betting a lot of you want to know if it runs on Windows 10 or not. After all, I proved 35 years of backwards
    compatibility was in fact a thing.</p>

<p>That being said, this article is already extremely long, so we'll have to pick this up at a later point. I'd love to
    hear your feedback, and if you really appreciate me, liking and subscribing to my channel does help a lot.</p>
